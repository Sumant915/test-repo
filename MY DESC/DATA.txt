Data is a collection of facts, figures, or other pieces of information that 

can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted to provide insights. It can be numerical 

(quantitative) or descriptive (qualitative) and is used for reasoning, calculation, 

and making decisions. In computing, it is often stored electronically in files or 

databases, and is the fuel for things like artificial intelligence and machine learning.
